This is a .NET Micro Framework project for a Netduino Plus to present room temperature and light information over the network.

Uses the astra.http project from http://forums.netduino.com/index.php?/topic/1345-pachube-client-for-netduinoplus/
and the Trigo class from http://www.microframework.nl/
and the NtpClient class by http://www.schwarz-interactive.de/

Pin layout information to come.
Includes a Munin script that graphs the data, requires pymetar (http://schwarzvogel.de/software-pymetar.shtml)
